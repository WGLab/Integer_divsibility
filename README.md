# Integer_divsibility
This page contains three files, including [Int_div_mod2](https://github.com/WGLab/Integer_divsibility/blob/main/Int_div_mod2.ipynb), [Int_div_mod3](https://github.com/WGLab/Integer_divsibility/blob/main/Int_div_mod3.ipynb) and [Fourier_series_regression](https://github.com/WGLab/Integer_divsibility/blob/main/Fourier_series_regression.ipynb), which are the code for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333) "Classification of integers based on residue classes via modern deep learning algorithms". All these three scripts incorporate data generation processes.

In particular, the "Int_div_mod2" and "Int_div_mod3" scripts outline a comprehensive examination of diverse deep learning architectures following distinct approaches to feature engineering. The outcome of this experimentation yielded results that were not only instinctive but also easily comprehensible. For a more in-depth analysis, we encourage readers to refer to the dedicated "Results" and "Discussion" sections in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333). Furthermore, for those inclined, our code can be readily modified and employed for personalized testing and exploration. This flexibility allows interested individuals to tailor the code to their specific requirements and objectives.

Furthermore, the paper incorporates a comprehensive exploration of the Fourier series regression method using ordinary least squares (OLS). This technique is extensively elucidated in Section 4.4 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333). The script "Fourier_series_regression" provides comprehensive implementations, and it can be easily modified for interested readers to explore different mod p classification problems.
