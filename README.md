# Integer_divsibility
This page contains two files, [Int_div_mod2](https://github.com/WGLab/Integer_divsibility/edit/main/Int_div_mod2.ipynb) and [Int_div_mod3](https://github.com/WGLab/Integer_divsibility/edit/main/Int_div_mod3.ipynb), which are the code for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01333) "Classification of integers based on residue classes by deep learning".
## Int_div_mod2
This python script contains all the testings of deep neual networks on mod 2 problem, including all the feature engineering listed in Table (1)(a) with the same order.
## Int_div_mod3
This python script contains all the testings of deep neural networks on mod 3 problem, including all the feature engineering listed in Table (1)(b) with the same order.
## Fourier series regression
The paper also includes the method of Fourier series regression (ordinary least square), which is very easy to reproduce with either "statsmodels" in Python or "lm" in R. As a result, we will not include the code here.
